# ubitextract
Utility to extract a Micropython program and/or interpreter from a microbit.

Install in a virtual environment:

```
python setup.py install
```

To run:

```
ubitextract -s extracted_script.py
```

To run the GUI there is no command line shortcut yet. So from this directory:

```
python ubitextract\gui.py
```
